# Electoral Process
This console application is developed in C#.
It is designed to support the count and results of an electoral process where there are three candidates (“April”, “Bill”, 'Clear').
Ask users how many voters they would have in their region. It asks each voter to vote for one of the 3 available candidates and at the end of the number of voters shows the number of votes for each candidate and who won.
  **This is an example for the election results:**
- Candidate A received << count of the number of votes for candidate A >> votes.
- Candidate B received << count of the number of votes from candidate B >> votes.
- Candidate C received << count of the number of votes from candidate C >> votes.
